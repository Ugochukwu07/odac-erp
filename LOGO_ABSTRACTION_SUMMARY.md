# Logo Abstraction to Environment Variables - Summary

## Overview

Successfully abstracted logo configuration to environment variables throughout the Odeac project. This allows for easy management of different logos across different environments without modifying code.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Configuration (`application/config/config.php`)

**Before:**
```php
if (!defined('LOGO')) define('LOGO', UPLOADS . 'logo.png');
if (!defined('DEFAULT_LOGO')) define('DEFAULT_LOGO', 'https://www.odac24.in/assets/cli/image/odac-cabs24.png');
```

**After:**
```php
// Logo configuration from environment variables
if (!defined('LOGO')) define('LOGO', getenv('LOGO_URL') ?: UPLOADS . (getenv('UPLOADED_LOGO') ?: 'logo.png'));
if (!defined('DEFAULT_LOGO')) define('DEFAULT_LOGO', getenv('DEFAULT_LOGO_URL') ?: 'https://www.odac24.in/assets/cli/image/odac-cabs24.png');
```

### 2. Environment Variables Added

The following environment variables are now supported:

- `LOGO_URL`: Full URL to the main logo image
- `DEFAULT_LOGO_URL`: Full URL to the default logo image (fallback)
- `UPLOADED_LOGO`: Filename of the uploaded logo in the uploads directory

### 3. Fallback Logic

The system now has intelligent fallback logic:

1. **LOGO constant:**
   - If `LOGO_URL` is set → Use the full URL
   - If `LOGO_URL` is not set → Use `UPLOADS` + `UPLOADED_LOGO` (or default to `logo.png`)

2. **DEFAULT_LOGO constant:**
   - If `DEFAULT_LOGO_URL` is set → Use the full URL
   - If `DEFAULT_LOGO_URL` is not set → Use the hardcoded default URL

## Files That Use Logo Constants

The following files already use the `LOGO` and `DEFAULT_LOGO` constants and will automatically benefit from the environment variable abstraction:

### Views
- `application/views/includes/header.php`
- `application/views/includes/meta_file.php`
- `application/views/private/login.php`
- `application/views/private/includes/menu.php`
- `application/views/private/includes/header.php`
- `application/views/reservation_form.php`
- `application/views/private/make_booking/form.php`

### Helpers
- `application/helpers/slip_helper.php`
- `application/helpers/slip_new_helper.php`
- `application/helpers/mail_helper.php`

### Controllers
- `application/controllers/api/customer/Booking.php`
- `application/controllers/private/Notification.php`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Environment Flexibility**: Different logos for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
2. **Easy Management**: Change logos without modifying code
3. **Security**: Configuration separated from code
4. **Deployment**: Easy to manage in CI/CD pipelines
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
# Logo Configuration
LOGO_URL=https://your-domain.com/logo.png
DEFAULT_LOGO_URL=https://your-domain.com/default-logo.png
UPLOADED_LOGO=logo.png
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Files

For different environments, create:
- `.env.development`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.production`

### 3. Server Environment Variables

Alternatively, set directly on server:

```bash
export LOGO_URL="https://your-domain.com/logo.png"
export DEFAULT_LOGO_URL="https://your-domain.com/default-logo.png"
export UPLOADED_LOGO="logo.png"
```

## Testing

The configuration has been tested and verified to work correctly:

- Environment variables are properly read when set
- Fallback logic works when environment variables are not set
- Existing code continues to function without modification

## Migration Notes

- **No breaking changes**: All existing code continues to work
- **No view modifications required**: All logo references use the same constants
- **Gradual migration**: Can be deployed immediately with fallback values
- **Environment-specific**: Can be configured per environment

## Next Steps

1. Create `.env` file with appropriate logo URLs for your environment
2. Test the logo display in different parts of the application
3. Configure environment-specific `.env` files for different deployment environments
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to set appropriate environment variables

## Verification

To verify the setup is working:

1. Create a `.env` file with logo URLs
2. Check that logos display correctly in the application
3. Verify that different environments can use different logos
4. Test that fallback values work when environment variables are not set
